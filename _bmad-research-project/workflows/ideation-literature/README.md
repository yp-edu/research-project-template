# Ideation & Literature

## Purpose

Guide researchers through the early research planning phase: ideation, hypothesis formation, and systematic literature review. Combines strategic guidance with literature expertise to establish a solid research foundation.

## Trigger

Trigger code: `IL` (Ideation & Literature)
Agents: Advisor + Scholar
Menu description: "Research planning & literature review 📚"

## Key Steps

1. **Research Ideation** (Advisor)
   - Explore research questions and hypotheses
   - Identify research direction and scope
   - Assess feasibility and impact potential
   - Connect to broader research goals

2. **Literature Discovery** (Scholar)
   - Identify key papers in the research domain
   - Discover recent advances and state-of-the-art
   - Find foundational and seminal work
   - Explore related work in adjacent domains

3. **Literature Analysis** (Scholar)
   - Analyze key papers in depth
   - Synthesize findings and identify trends
   - Identify gaps in current research
   - Understand methodologies used in the field

4. **Research Planning** (Advisor + Scholar)
   - Refine research questions based on literature
   - Position work in the research landscape
   - Plan research approach and methodology
   - Establish research timeline and milestones

5. **Documentation**
   - Create research plan document
   - Document literature review findings
   - Organize related work structure
   - Save insights for future reference

## Expected Output

- Research plan with clear questions and hypotheses
- Literature review document with key papers and findings
- Related work outline and positioning
- Research direction and approach documented
- Foundation for baseline development

## Notes

This workflow will be implemented using the create-workflow workflow.
- Requires collaboration between Advisor (strategy) and Scholar (literature)
- Should produce documents that feed into baseline development workflow
- Literature findings should be saved for use in paper writing later
