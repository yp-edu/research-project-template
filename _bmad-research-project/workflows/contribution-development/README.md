# Contribution Development

## Purpose

Develop novel research contributions through iterative experimentation and paper writing. Combines strategic guidance, experimental implementation, and writing to create and document new research contributions.

## Trigger

Trigger code: `CD` (Contribution Development)
Agents: Advisor + Engineer + Writer
Menu description: "Create novel contributions 💡"

## Key Steps

1. **Contribution Design** (Advisor + Engineer)
   - Design novel methods or approaches
   - Plan experimental validation
   - Assess contribution novelty and impact
   - Ensure alignment with research goals

2. **Implementation** (Engineer)
   - Implement novel contributions
   - Follow best practices (PEP 8, reproducibility, interpretability tools)
   - Integrate with existing baselines
   - Set up experiment tracking

3. **Experimentation** (Engineer)
   - Design experiments to validate contributions
   - Run experiments with proper controls
   - Perform ablation studies
   - Track all results systematically

4. **Results Analysis** (Engineer + Advisor)
   - Analyze experimental results
   - Interpret findings and implications
   - Identify strengths and limitations
   - Assess contribution impact

5. **Paper Writing** (Writer)
   - Write methods section for contributions
   - Document experimental results
   - Create results and discussion sections
   - Ensure reproducibility sections included
   - Highlight contributions and novelty

6. **Iteration** (All agents)
   - Review results and writing
   - Refine experiments if needed
   - Update paper sections based on findings
   - Iterate until contributions are clear and validated

## Expected Output

- Implemented novel contributions with code
- Experimental results validating contributions
- Complete paper sections (methods, results, discussion)
- Clear documentation of contributions and novelty
- Ready for review and revision

## Notes

This workflow will be implemented using the create-workflow workflow.
- Requires close collaboration between Advisor (strategy), Engineer (implementation), and Writer (documentation)
- Should support iterative development where experiments inform writing and vice versa
- Must maintain reproducibility and best practices throughout
- Outputs feed into review and revision workflow
