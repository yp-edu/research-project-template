# Baseline Development

## Purpose

Understand state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and implement baseline experiments. Combines literature understanding, experimental implementation, and initial paper writing to establish experimental foundation.

## Trigger

Trigger code: `BD` (Baseline Development)
Agents: Engineer + Scholar + Writer
Menu description: "SOTA understanding & baselines 🔬"

## Key Steps

1. **SOTA Understanding** (Scholar)
   - Review and analyze baseline methods from literature
   - Understand implementation details of key papers
   - Identify evaluation metrics and experimental setups
   - Document baseline methodologies

2. **Baseline Implementation** (Engineer)
   - Design experimental setup for baselines
   - Implement baseline methods (following best practices: PEP 8, reproducibility, BenchMARL for MARL)
   - Set up experiment tracking (TensorBoard, W&B)
   - Ensure reproducibility (fixed seeds, version control, logging)

3. **Experiment Execution** (Engineer)
   - Run baseline experiments
   - Track results and metrics
   - Save checkpoints and logs
   - Document experimental setup

4. **Results Analysis** (Engineer + Writer)
   - Analyze baseline results
   - Compare with reported SOTA results
   - Identify discrepancies or insights
   - Document findings

5. **Initial Writing** (Writer)
   - Write methods section for baselines
   - Document experimental setup
   - Create initial results section
   - Organize related work based on baselines

## Expected Output

- Implemented baseline methods with reproducible code
- Experimental results and analysis
- Initial paper sections (methods, results, related work)
- Understanding of SOTA and experimental landscape
- Foundation for contribution development

## Notes

This workflow will be implemented using the create-workflow workflow.
- Requires collaboration between Engineer (implementation), Scholar (literature), and Writer (documentation)
- Should produce code, results, and paper sections that feed into contribution development
- Must follow reproducibility best practices throughout
